## 🏆 Objective

### 1. Track Employee Attendance
- Mark daily attendance for each employee (Present, Absent, Leave, Late).
- Maintain date-wise records to track attendance history.
- Provide check-in/check-out time tracking for companies where timing matters.

### 2. Maintain Digital Records
- Store all attendance data in a MongoDB database instead of manual registers.
- Implement a paperless system to reduce workload.
- Ensure data safety, preventing loss compared to traditional registers or Excel files.

### 3. Generate Reports
- View monthly attendance percentage.
- Analyze department-wise absenteeism.
- Generate employee-specific reports for frequent lateness.
- Provide CSV download options for HR and administrative purposes.

### 4. Employee Management
- Add or remove employees as needed.
- Maintain promotion records (e.g., Junior → Senior).
- Update employee details such as mobile number, email, and department changes.

### 5. User-Friendly Web Interface
- Built using Streamlit for an interactive and intuitive experience.
- Works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.
- Simple buttons and forms ensure usability without technical knowledge.

### 6. Security and Privacy
- Uses a local MongoDB database for secure data storage on company servers.
- Only HR/admin has access; it is not a public system.

## 🚀 Final Goal
- Automate the company’s attendance tracking system.
- Reduce HR’s manual work, saving valuable time.
- Maintain accurate records for seamless salary calculations.
- Analyze data to identify disciplined employees and improve workforce management.

## 🎯 Why Is This Useful?
